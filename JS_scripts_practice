-—write a script to display today’s date in the format: mm/dd/yyyy


var today = new Date();
var month = today.getMonth();
var day = today.getDate();
var year = today.getFullYear();

if (month <= 9) {month = '0' + month};
if (day <= 9) {day = '0' + day};

console.log("The date is: " + month +"/" + day +"/" + year);




--Write a JavaScript program that creates a random integer between 1 and 10, 
and promts the user to input a guess number. 
If the user input matches the random number, the program will display a message "Good guess."
otherwise it will display a message "Not matched".

** I took it a little further and had it display the random number to the user as well, 
   mostly so I would know it was working. This turned out to be a good move, because from this 
   I realized it was returning a "No match..." message even when I was guessing the right number. 
   I realized that the userguess variable might not actually be a number and be === the randomNumber variable, 
   which seemed more likely to be an actual number...so I switched === to == in that else if statement 
   and it worked... which made me very happy.


var randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random()*10)+1;
var userGuess = window.prompt("Enter a number between 1 and 10.");

if (userGuess < 1){
  alert("Choose a number between 1 and 10!");
} else if (userGuess > 10){
  alert("Choose a number between 1 and 10!");
} else if (isNaN(userGuess)){
  alert("That wasn't even a number...");
} else if (userGuess == randomNumber){
  alert("Nice guess, you were correct!");
} else {alert("No match, the number was " +randomNumber + ". Would you like to try again?");
};
